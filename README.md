# About #

The Crossword Builder app aids in the construction of crossword puzzles.


# Overview #

We're using the mono-repo pattern to colocate three sub-projects:

front_end/

    Contains the JavaScript web app.

back_end/

    Contains the API.

scraper/

    Contains a tool for building a dictionary of common crossword puzzle answers
    used by the app when making suggestions.

See each sub-project's README for more information.
